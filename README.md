Explore and Summarize Data: Red Wine Quality using R programming

# Objective
To conduct my own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice.
The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.

# Introduction
The dataset I chose to explore is the Red Wine Quality. I chose this dataset just out of interest :) ! 
This dataset was already structured as a result I did not need to restructure it or data munging was not necessary.
Dataset was obtained from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).</br>
### Problem Statement
The guiding question for this dataset is “Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?”.</br>
### The Data
This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). This data set is a tidy set hence there is no need to clean it. It contains some important characteristics of red wines such as its pH, density, alcohol% present etc.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
For EDA, Univariate, Bivariate and Mulit-variate Analyses were conducted and further conclusions were drawn from these 
analyses.</br>
The detailed project is published on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/isammitr/redwines).
